# The Charm++ Ecosystem

Charm++ is a C++ based parallel programming system based on an introspective adaptive runtime system, with many features suitable for addressing upcoming extreme scale as well as mid-scale challenges, and with multiple highly scalable parallel applications such as NAMD, ChaNGa, and OpenAtom.

Our group's goal is to develop technology that improves performance of parallel applications while also improving programmer productivity. We aim to reach a point where, with our freely distributed software base, complex irregular and dynamic applications can (a) be developed quickly and (b) perform scalably on machines with thousands of processors.

# The Charm++ Workshop

The workshop is broadly focused on adaptivity in highly scalable parallel computing. It also takes stock of recent results in adaptive runtime techniques in Charm++ and the collaborative interdisciplinary research projects developed using it.
